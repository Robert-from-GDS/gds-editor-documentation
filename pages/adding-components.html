<h1>Adding Components to the Scene</h1>

<p>Once you've created or opened a scene, you can add components or create new ones at any time during your workflow. GDS Editor supports both the addition and creation of a wide variety of components. You can find detailed information in the <small title="open documents page components introduction" class="docLink" onclick="docLink('components-intro')"> Components section</small> of these documents.</p>

<p>There are two main methods for adding components in GDS Editor:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Importing external components</strong> from your local disk or from GDS Editor libraries.</li>
  <li><strong>Creating components</strong> using GDS Editor‚Äôs built-in generation tools, such as panel and background generators, brush and shape tools, and the text tool.</li>
</ul>

<p class="subTitle">üì• Importing PNGs, SVGs, and GDS Files</p>
<p>You can import <code>.png</code>, <code>.svg</code>, and <code>.gds</code> files into GDS Editor using the <span class="hotkey">  ‚å®Ô∏è  I hotkey. </span> This opens your system file dialog, where you can select files to import. Uploaded files will appear in the center of the workspace, ready for editing.</p>

<p class="subTitle">üìö Importing from Libraries</p>
<p>If you are a GDS Editor supporter through the GDS Plus membership on the Game Developer Studio website, you can directly import assets from the GDS libraries. These libraries contain high-quality, ready-to-use assets prepared specifically for GDS Editor.</p>
<p>To import from the library, use the library import button on the scene
<small class="imgLink" onmousedown="imgLink('https://gds-editor.b-cdn.net/docs/image/work_bar.png')">"work bar"</small>, or press the <span class="hotkey"> 
  ‚å®Ô∏è L  hotkey </span> to open the GDS Supporter Library. Simply click on an asset pack to import it. GDS Editor will then ask whether you‚Äôd like to import the assets as a new scene or add them to your current scene.</p>

<p class="subTitle">üé® Creating Components</p>
<p>GDS Editor‚Äôs core and Plus tools also allow you to create components directly within a scene. Use the right side of the  scene <b></b>
<small class="imgLink" onmousedown="imgLink('https://gds-editor.b-cdn.net/docs/image/work_bar.png')">"work bar"</small> at the bottom of the scene layout. As of version <strong>1.6.1601</strong>, you can create basic text components, draw brush strokes with the Brush Tool, and add shapes using the Shape Tool.</p>
<p>GDS Plus supporters also gain access to advanced creation tools for GUI design, including buttons, panels, and card generators, as well as the conceptual Title Text component (planned for future updates) and many more upcoming tools.</p>
