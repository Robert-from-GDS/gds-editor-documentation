<h1>Saving a Scene</h1>

<p>You can save a scene at any time during your workflow. Saving is simple, and there are several methods:</p>

<p class="subTitle">üíæ Saving a Scene</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the hotkey <span class="hotkey">Control + S</span> to save a .gds file on your local disk. <i>Unless you rename the save destination, the file name will match your scene name.</i></li>
  <li>Use the quick action icon at the top of the Scene Palette to save your scene.</li>
  <li>Via the right-click context menu by right-clicking on the scene area with no components selected. <small class="docLink" onclick="docLink('mouse-controls')">Mouse control instructions</small></li>
  <li>Via the Scene Settings menu.</li>
</ul>

<div class="important">
  Currently, GDS Editor does not have an autosave feature, so be sure to save regularly.
</div>

<p class="subTitle">üìÑ GDS File Format</p>
<p>Only GDS Editor can read and parse the .gds file format. This means you cannot drop .gds files into other editors such as Photoshop or Illustrator. If you wish to use your work in those programs, you will need to export all components as PNGs and load them as layers.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the .gds file is just structured JSON data, so it might be possible in the future to build a converter.</p>

<p class="subTitle">üóÇ Saving in Other File Formats</p>
<p>Currently, GDS files can only be saved and exported as .gds files. It is not possible to save the entire scene in other formats such as .psd, .svg, or .pdf. You can, however, export individual components in their respective formats.</p>
<p>In the future, I may add support for exporting whole scenes in other formats, but this is currently a low priority.</p>

<p class="subTitle">‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Saving</p>
<p>Currently, and likely into the foreseeable future, there are no cloud saving or sharing features available in the editor. To keep cloud backups of your work, it is recommended to save your .gds files into your preferred cloud service folder (OneDrive, iCloud, Google Drive, etc.).</p>
