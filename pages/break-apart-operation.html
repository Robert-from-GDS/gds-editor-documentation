<h1>Break Apart Operation</h1>

<p>
The Break Apart operation allows you to take any visual component and separate it into individual “pixel islands.” 
A pixel island is a visually isolated group of pixels surrounded by transparent space (alpha). 
A common example is a texture atlas, where multiple graphics are packed into a single transparent PNG image.
</p>


<p class="subTitle">Accessing Break Apart</p>
<p>
The Break Apart operation can be performed on any visual component through the right-click context menu. 
Select a component, then right-click on it to open the component menu. 
When only one component is selected, the <strong>Break Apart</strong> option will appear in the menu.
</p>

<p>
Because Break Apart is a heavy processing operation, it can only be applied to a single component at a time.  
If multiple components are selected, the option will not appear in the context menu.
</p>


<p class="subTitle">How Break Apart Works</p>
<p>
Break Apart analyzes the selected component and separates its pixel islands into new independent components.  
All resulting components are created as type <strong>"png"</strong>.  
Only pixels that belong to each island are preserved — even if other pixels exist within the bounding box, they are clipped away.
</p>

<p>
Break Apart currently does not apply any alpha threshold.  
Any pixel with non-zero opacity (even 0.001) is considered part of an island.
</p>

<p>
When the operation completes, the new components are added to the scene and automatically named using the parent component's name with a child number appended.
</p>

<p>
If no pixel islands are detected, the operation will safely cancel without creating any new components.
</p>

<p>
If pixel islands appear to be connected due to semi-transparent pixels, you can use the <strong>Scalpel</strong> tool to manually remove unwanted pixels before performing Break Apart.
