<h1>Components Introduction</h1>

<p>
Unlike a basic drawing app (which GDS Editor is not), you can create many different kinds of graphical objects on your scene.  
Each object you create or import is called a <b>‚Äúcomponent‚Äù</b>.  
Depending on its <b>"component type"</b>, it has its own unique properties and abilities.  
</p>

<p><b>For example:</b> <br>
‚úÖ A <b>Text Component</b> has properties like <i>bold</i>, <i>italic</i>, and abilities like changing text content or color</br> 
‚úÖ An <b>Image Component</b> has properties like <i>hue</i>, <i>saturation</i>, and abilities like adjusting brightness or filters.  
</p>

<p>
GDS Editor manages all aspects of components, giving you a clean and simple UI for editing them. However,
it‚Äôs important to understand that even if two components <i>look</i> the same on the scene, they may behave differently based on their "component type". 
For example, a  photo or image  of text  looks like text but can‚Äôt be edited (font, size, bold, etc.), while a  GDS text component  is fully editable in a textual way.

üí° <b>Tip for game devs:</b> If you come from a game development background, think of GDS Editor like a ‚Äúgame art engine‚Äù.  
Just like in a standard game engine, different component types can be created or imported, each with their own properties and methods.
