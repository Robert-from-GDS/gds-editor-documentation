<p>
  GDS Editor follows a logical layout, with each section of the application window dedicated to a specific function. 
  The left side of the window is focused on scene control, while the right side is dedicated to component control. 
  Components can be added and created from the work bar at the bottom of the window, and their interaction with the scene is managed from the top of the window.
