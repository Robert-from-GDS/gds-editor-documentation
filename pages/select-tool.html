  <p>
    The <strong>Select Rectangle</strong>, often referred to as the <em>rubber band tool</em>, allows users to quickly select multiple components on the stage by drawing a rectangular area. It‚Äôs a fast, intuitive way to manage selections.

  <p class="subTitle">üñ± How to Use</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hold the Control key</strong> on your keyboard</li>
    <li><strong>Click and drag</strong> with the <strong>left mouse button</strong> across the stage</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can fine-tune how the Select Rectangle behaves via the <strong>Settings panel</strong>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Touch Mode</strong>: Selects any component that intersects with the rectangle‚Äîeven partially.</li>
    <li><strong>Englobed Mode</strong>: Selects only components that are <em>fully contained</em> within the rectangle.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This lets users choose between precision and speed depending on their workflow.</p>

  <p class="subTitle">‚ûï Selection Behavior</p>
  <p>You can also configure how selections are handled:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Add to Selection</strong>: Newly selected items are added to the current selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Replace Selection</strong>: Clears the previous selection and replaces it with the new one.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These options work in tandem with the rectangle mode (Touch or Englobed), giving users full control over how selections are built.</p>
