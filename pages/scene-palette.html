<h1>The Scene Palette</h1>

<p>
  Once you have added or created a component in your scene, you will notice that
  it not only appears directly on the scene but also as an item in the
  <b>Scene Palette</b>. This palette entry makes it easy to locate your
  component anywhere in the scene. The Scene Palette also lets you manage your
  scene, organize components into categories, and perform bulk actions.
</p>

<div class="tip">
  <p>üí° 
    The Scene Palette is collapsible. You can expand or hide it to keep your
    workspace clean. Most actions can be controlled by hotkeys, so it‚Äôs not
    always necessary to have the palette expanded.

<p class="subTitle">Useful Features of the Scene Palette</p>

<p>
  The Scene Palette provides features to help you control and manage your
  components. Here are some tips to make the most of it:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Clicking on a component in the list will also select it on the scene.
  </li>

    When selecting a component from the list, the component will briefly shake,
    giving you a visual indication of which one is selected.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hold the <span class="hotKey">‚å®Ô∏è ALT</span> key while clicking a component in
    the list to center the scene on that component (and select it).
  </li>
  <li>
    Hold the <span class="hotKey">‚å®Ô∏è SHIFT</span> key while selecting a component
    to add it to your current selection.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press <span class="hotKey">‚å®Ô∏è TAB</span> or
    <span class="hotKey">‚å®Ô∏è Backquote (`)</span> to move up and down the component
    list.
