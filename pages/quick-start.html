  <p>In order to work in gds editor you will need to create a scene. A scene is a workspace that will contain components that you create or import into gds editor. Each scene can contain a multitude of varying component types. Components are assets that you create or import into the scene.</p>
  
  <p>You can create as many scenes as you need and move components between scenes using copy and paste as well as the send to scene option. Although you can create as many scenes as you need it's good practice keep your scene count as low as possible and tidy unused and holder scenes.</p>
  
  <p>To create a new scene use the "add scene button" in the scene tab container on the far left of the interface. Clicking this button will open the "new scene dialog" the new scene dialog will ask if you would like to load an existing scene from a gds file or if you would like to create a new blanks scene. </p>
  
  <p class="tip">You can obtain gds Files fromm game developer studio asset packs or from previous save files you create for yourself.</p>
  
  <p>As well as loading previous save files and creating a custom blank scenes you can create new scenes from the preset list. the scene preset lists offers handy scene sizes targeting often used screen sizes, platforms and devices common to game development.</p>
  
  <p>You can also create a scene by dragging in an svg,png, or gds file directly into the workspace. If no scene is open gds editor will create a new scene for you at the defualt scene size of 1920 poxels by 1080 pixels.</p>
  
 <p class="subTitle">creating a blank scene</p>
  <p>After creating a new scene from the custom scene size creator or from the preset list you can see that gds editor generates a new scene tab in the "scene tab holder" and a new scene workarea. </p>
  
  <p class="subTitle"> loading an existing file.</p>
  <p>You can also create a new scene by loading an existing scene file. Loading an existing scene file will also  create a new scene workspace and also import any components contained within the scene file and restore the previous scene state.</p>
