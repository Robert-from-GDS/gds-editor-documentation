<h1>Creating a New Scene</h1>

<p>There are several ways to create a new scene. When you first open GDS Editor, a default 1920 Ã— 1080 pixel scene is automatically created. You can start working on this scene immediately, or create a new scene with your own settings. Additionally, if you have a previously saved scene from a GDS file or a GDS file from a downloaded asset pack, you can load it into the editor.</p>

<p class="subTitle">âž• Creating a Scene</p>
<p>You can create a new scene at any time using the following methods:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Press the hotkey <span class="hotkey">N</span> to open the New Scene dialog.</li>
  <li>Use the "Add Scene" button in the Scene Tab panel on the left side of the interface <small class="imgLink" onmousedown="imgLink('https://gds-editor.b-cdn.net/docs/image/general_layout.png')"> scene tabs #2 </small> .</li>
  <li>Click the "Create New Scene" button on the Welcome Window when first starting the editor. <small>*Make sure the welcome window is visible if you previously turned it off.</small></li>
  <li>Drag a saved GDS scene file into the editor. You will be prompted to either load it as a new scene or merge it into the current scene.</li>
</ul>
